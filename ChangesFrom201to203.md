# Changes in 2.0.3 #

Here is a brief list of the changes from version 2.0.1 to 2.0.3. Please note that the versions are API compatible, i.e. if your code works with 2.0.0 or 2.0.1, it will work with 2.0.3 without changing the code.

  * `TextArea` can now be modified (experimental feature)
  * Invisible components no longer receives focus
  * Added experimental support for F1 - F12 keys
  * Font fixes, hopefully it will look better on Linux now
  * The size policies are working better now, but they are still somewhat mysterious, will try to come up with something better for the 2.1 release

## What about 2.0.2? ##
There's no 2.0.2, I did a mistake when staging the new release and had to start over again, but 2.0.2 had already been tagged in Mercurial so I couldn't re-release it. Instead, we skipped a number and landed on 2.0.3. Nevermind.
